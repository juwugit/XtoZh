If you cannot commit your modification via ssh key, see following lines.

Github seems only supports ssh way to read&write the repo, although https way also 
displayed 'Read&Write'.

So you need to change your repo config on your PC to ssh way:

   1. edit .git/config file under your repo directory

   2. find url=entry under section [remote "origin"]

   3. change it from url=https://juwugit@github.com/juwugit/XtoZh.git
      to url=ssh://git@github.com/juwugit/XtoZh.git
      that is, change all the texts before @ symbol to ssh://git

   4. Save config file and quit. now you could use git push origin master
      to sync your repo on GitHub
