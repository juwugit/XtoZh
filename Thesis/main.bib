%--- COMMENTS may be placed outside the @ENTRYTYPE{ ... } stuctures
%--- CMS guidelines
%---- All URLs for CMS notes, ANs, etc, should refer to the CDS server, not the CMS server. Use our standard format for them, as shown below.
%---- If a collaboration is referenced by the collaboration name, it should be listed in the AUTHOR field. If by a first author + "and others", the collaboration name must be listed in the COLLABORATION field.
%----   We use the collaboration in preference to the author field, but most journals will list both, so include both.
%---- Number of authors to list:
%----   PRL requests that we include all authors up to fifteen except for large collaborations, and we take this as our internal guide as well.
%----   The individual journal bib style file (theirs, ours, PLB, etc.) will truncate at the appropriate point. We have ours set to _3_ as
%----   a reminder to list the appropriate number. For large collaborations, just use first author + "and others".
%---- Use only the URL field instead of embedding an href (this is a change in our practice).
%---- A reference only published on the arXiv should be listed as UNPUBLISHED (with a note "Submitted to XXX" for CMS or ATLAS papers).
%---- Some journals will lowercase the title: use {} to protect words which must be capitalized, e.g., {LHC}, {TeV}, {CERN}, {CMS}. Do not escape the entire title as it will then clash with the journal style.
%---- Journal names: the journals generally include the series in the journal name, "Physical Review D", vol 5, rather than PR D5
