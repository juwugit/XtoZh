\chapter{Analysis Procedures}

In this chapter, the analysis procedures of the search for $Z'$ decaying into $Z$h in $llbb$ final state are reported. The data sets and Monte Carlo (MC) samples we used in this analysis will be indicated. Physics objects reconstruction and event selections are also introduced. Moreover, background yields and the effects of systematic uncertainties will be demonstrated in the end of this chapter.

\section{Monte Carlo Samples and Data sets}

\subsection{Signal MC}
As introduced in section 1.2.3, the signal hypothesis is HVT model B benchmark. The heavy resonance ($Z'$) is tested using a wide set of masses from 800 GeV to 2000 GeV, one masspoint every 100 GeV (Tab.~\ref{tab:TableSignalMC}). The signal is simulated by MadGraph5\_aMC$@$NLO\cite{MG5} in LO mode, as a narrow spin-1 neutral resonance and is forced to decay in the $Z'\rightarrow Zh\rightarrow llqq$ channel. Showering and hadronization are performed with PYTHIA6\cite{PYTHIA}.
