\chapter{Analysis Procedures}

In this chapter, the analysis procedures of the search for $Z'$ decaying into $Z$h in $llbb$ final state are reported. The data sets and Monte Carlo (MC) samples we used in this analysis will be indicated. Physics objects reconstruction and event selections are also introduced. Moreover, background yields and the effects of systematic uncertainties will be discussed in the end of this chapter.

\section{Monte Carlo Samples and Data sets}

\subsection{Signal MC}
As introduced in section 1.2.3, the signal hypothesis is HVT model B benchmark. The heavy resonance ($Z'$) is tested using a wide set of masses from 800 GeV to 2000 GeV, one masspoint every 100 GeV (Table~\ref{tab:TableSignalMC}). The signal is generated by MadGraph5\_aMC$@$NLOv5.2.2.1\cite{MG5} in LO mode, as a narrow spin-1 neutral resonance and is forced to decay in the $Z'\rightarrow Zh\rightarrow llqq$ channel. Showering and hadronization are performed with PYTHIA6\cite{PYTHIA}.

\subsection{Background MC}
Since we are looking for new resonances decaying in semi-leptonic final state, the background samples of this analysis are originated by all SM events with two leptons and at least one jet as final state. The dominant background contribution is the produciton of Z boson with jets. This Z+jets sample is produced by MADGRAPH. In the matrix element level, the Z boson is forced to decay into two leptons, and further this sample is divided into two samples depending on the Z $p_{T}$, higher than 100 GeV or between 70 and 100 GeV. The contribution of events with Z $p_{T}$ less than 70 GeV is negligible due to further cut on the objects $p_{T}$ in the selection criteria.

The second dominant source of background is $t\bar{t}$ production. Both of the two top quarks decay into the final state (top decays into a W boson and a b quark first) that gives two charged leptons, neutrinos and two b-jets. This sample is generated by POWHEGv1\cite{POWHEG}.

Other sources of background considered are SM di-boson productions (WW, WZ and ZZ) generated by PYTHIA6. All the background samples are required to pass phase-space cuts, $p_{T}^{ll} > $60 GeV and 60$ < M_{ll} < $120 GeV. Related statistics are reported in Table~\ref{tab:TabBkgMC}.

\subsection{Data Samples}
In this analysis, the full CMS data collected in 2012 are used, corresponding to the integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = $8 TeV. For each lepton channel, there are four datasets. All datasets are collected with a double muon or a double electron trigger, as explained in detail in the next section. The trigger algorithm employed for the electron samples doesn't use any information from the tracker but only the energy deposite in the ECAL. This expedient is implemented in order to avoid any possible inefficiencies due to the presence of two tracks very close to each other when the Z is highly boosted and its decay products are very collimated. Such a trigger is contained in the Photon/DoublePhotonHighPt dataset. The full dataset names are listed in Table~\ref{tab:TabDataSet}.

\end{center}

\section{Trigger}
Since the final state contains two leptons of the same flavour and at least one jet, we perform this analysis on the DoubleMu and Photon/DoublePhotonHighPt datasets. The first dataset is triggered by two muons, the second one is triggered by two eletrons. These triggers are:
\begin{itemize}
\item HLT\_Mu22\_TkMu8* (for DoubleMu datasets)
\item HLT\_DoubleEle33\_* (for Photon/DoublePhontonHighPt datasets)
\end{itemize}

The muon trigger has a double $p_{T}$ threshold, requires leading muon $p_{T}$ greater than 22 GeV and sub-leading muon $p_{T}$ greater than 8 GeV. Differently, the double electron trigger requires a higher threshold of 33 GeV on both electrons. The trigger efficiencies are close to 1 in both cases.

\section{Physics Objects}

\subsection{Muon}
\subsection*{Reconstruction}
The muon reconstruction algorithm at CMS takes advantage of the redundancy of detection methods. Muon tracks are first reconstructed independently in the inner tracker (tracker track) and in the muon system (standalone track). Based on these objects, two reconstruction approaches are used\cite{MuonReco}:
\begin{itemize}
\item $Globol~Muon$ (outside-in): Starting from a standalone track, this algorithm finds a best tracker track to match the standalone track. Then, the fit of the track is repeated using the hits both in the tracker and in the muon system\cite{KF}. The resulting object is called a $Global~Muon$. At large transverse momentum ($p_{t} > $200 GeV), the global muon fit can improve the momentum resolution compared to the tracker-only fit.
\item $Tracker~Muon$ (inside-out): A tracker muon is reconstructed using an opposite direction of the direction for a global muon. In this approach, all tracker tracks with $p_{T} >$ 0.5 GeV and the total momentum $p >$ 2.5 GeV are considered as possible muon candidates. The extrapolation to the muon system takes into account the magnetic field, average expected energy losses, and multiple scattering in the detector material. If at least one muon segment matches the extrapolated track, the corresponding track track qualifies as a $Tracker~Muon$. This algorithm is useful for low-$p_{T}$ muons that do not fully penetrate the muon system, and therefore only register a few hits.
\end{itemize}

If no match is found when extrapolating outside-in, the standalone track is stored as a $Stanalone~Muon$. This happens only for less than 1\% of the muons produced in a collison, and the reconstruction efficiency is about 99\% for the muon which carries enough high momentum within detector coverage\cite{MuonReco}.

\newpage
\subsection*{Identification}
We use both tracker muons and global muons in this analysis. To identify muons from the signal, the muons must pass one of these two off-line selections, high$-p_{T}$ muon ID or tracker-based muon ID\cite{MuonID}. The requirements are listed as follows:\\

High-$p_{T}$ muon ID
\begin{itemize}
\item Muon identified as a $Global~Muon$.
\item Number of muon hits in the global track $> 0$.
\item Number of matched muon stations $> 1$.
\item Number of pixel hits $> 0$.
\item Number of tracker layers with hits $> 8$.
\item Transverse impact parameter $d_{xy} < 0.2$ cm.
\item Longitudinal impact parameter $d_{z} < 0.5$ cm.
\item Relative error on the track transverse momentum $\sigma_{p_{T}}/p_{T} < 0.3$.\\
\end{itemize}

In the tracker-based muon ID, the muon has to be identified as a $Tracker~Muon$, and the requirement of muon hits in the global track is removed. Other requirements are the same.

An additional useful variable for lepton identification is the isolation. It is defined as the scalar sum of the $p_{T}$ of the reconstructed objects within a cone (typical size is $\Delta R=0.3$, $\Delta R \equiv\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}$) space around the lepton track but excluding the $p_{T}$ of the lepton itself. Moreover, the relative isolation is defined as isolation divided by the lepton $p_{T}$ ($I_{rel} = Iso/p_{T}^{lep}$). The relative isolation is more frequently used in the modern analysis.

In this analysis, a modified isolation criteria is used. The two muons originated from boosted Z decay are close to each other, and consequently the presence of another muon in the isolation cone could break the function of this variable. In order to solve this problem we use a tracker-based isolation relative quantity, explicitely removing the momentum flow from any other muon passing our muon selection. Moreover, a tracker-based isolation is well motivated also by two additional aspects: it is more independent of pile up (pile-up tracks tipically do not match the primary vertex) and does not include possible muon radiation. Finally, the modified requirement is $I_{rel}^{mod} < 0.1$.\\

\subsection{Electron}

\subsection*{Reconstruction}
Electrons are reconstructed from energy deposits in the ECAL matched to tracks reconstructed in the silicon tracker. They have less distinguishable signatures than muons in the detector due to the jet-induced background in ECAL. Therefore, to reconstruct an election, it's essential to find a briliant way to match the infomation acquired in both tracker and ECAL.

\subsection*{Clustering}
For every single hit from an electron in ECAL, approximately 94\% of energy is contained in 3$\times$3 crystals and 97\% in 5$\times$5 crystals. To form a cluster, crystals with $E_{T} > 1$ GeV is picked as seeds. Then starting from seed crystal, dominos of size 1$\times$3 or 1$\times$5 are created in $\eta-\phi$ plane. If the energy of these dominos exceed 0.1 GeV threshold, thus added up the energy of dominos along the $\phi$ direction.

Moreover, the effects of conversion process and bremsstrahlung radiation must be taken into account to reconstruct the electron energy more precisely. The concept of electron superclustering is to collect the energy of photons from bremsstrahlung radiation along the $\phi$ direction with fixed $\eta$ width of the seed crystal. The technical details of the supercluster can be found in\cite{eleSC}.

\subsection*{Tracking}
There are several steps to reconstruct electron tracks in CMS experiment. The hit on the pixel and the tracker are reconstructed in the first step. The second step is to find the seed of tracks by matching at least two hits in pixel detector. Lst step is to fit the trajetory starting from the seed. To perform this fit, the Gaussian-sum filter (GSF) algorithm is used\cite{GSF}. In GSF algorithm, the energy loss probability density function is constructed by multiple Gaussian functions. Finally, the electrons are built by matching the superclusters to the GSF tracks. Reconstruction efficiencies for electrons $E_{T} > 20$ GeV are generally above 95\% in EB and 90\% in EE\cite{eleRecoEff}.

\subsection*{Identification}
The electron identification used in this analysis is based on HEEPv4.1\cite{HEEP}. As what we did for the muon id, we need to modify the isolation definition again because of the small $\Delta R$ between two electrons. The requirements are listed as follows:\\

Modified HEEPv4.1 electron ID
\begin{itemize}
\item Transversal supercluster energy $>$ 35 GeV.
\item Pseudorapidity of supercluster $|\eta_\mathrm{SC}| < 1.442$ for barrel electrons, or $1.56 < |\eta_{\mathrm{SC}}| < 2.5$ for endcap electrons.
\item Have either $E_{2\times 5}/E_{5\times 5} > 0.94$ or $E_{1\times 5}/E_{5\times 5} > 0.83$.
\item Ratio of HCAL deposit energy to ECAL deposit energy (Fig.~\ref{fig:E5X5}) smaller than 0.5.
\item Number of inner layer lost hits smaller than 2.
\item Have $|d_{xy}| < 0.02$ cm for barrel electrons, or $|d_{xy}| < 0.05$ cm for endcap electrons.\\
\end{itemize}

As what we did for the muon id, by the same reason we need to modify the isolation definition again. In this case there are three isolation variables that have to be changed.

\begin{itemize}
\item Modified track isolation is required be to lower than 5 GeV. This variable is defined as the scalar $p_{T}$ sum of the tracks within a $\Delta R$ = 0.3 cone around the electron, and excluding the $p_{T}$ of another electron which passes the above selections and its track is inside the cone.
\item The electromagnetic calorimeter isolation $I_{ECAL}$ is defined as the scalar sum of $E_{T}$ of the crystals in a $\Delta R$ = 0.3 cone around the particular electron (an inner area of full-width 3 crystal), excluding a 4 crystals width around any other electron. The dimension of the ECAL crystals corresponds roughly at $\Delta R \sim 0.01 \textup{ to } 0.02$. The threshold of $I_{ECAL}$ is varying with the electron transverse energy.
\item The hadronic calorimeter isolation $I_{HCAL}$ is defined as the scalar sum of $E_{T}$ of the HCAL caloTowers with a center in a $\Delta R$ = 0.3 cone around the electron, excluding those lying within $\Delta R$ = 0.15 of the electron itself and of any other electron\cite{CMS_AN_2012-168}. The threshold of this variable also varies with the electron transverse energy.

\subsection{Jet}
Since gluons and quarks cannot exist in free state due to the color confinement\cite{confinement}, they fragment into hadrons. The result of this fragmentation (or called the "hadronization") is a jet of particles depositing energy in the detectors.

\subsection*{Reconstruction}
Jet clustering algorithms are among the main tools for analyzing data from hadronic collisions. In this section, an extensively used clustering algorithm called "sequential recombination algorithm"\cite{AKalgo,CAalgo1} will be introduced. At first, events are reconstructed using the particle flow algorithm (PF)\cite{PFalgo}, which attempts to identify and measure all the stable particles in a collision by combining information from all the sub-detectors. The PF algorithm categorizes all particles into five types: muons, electrons, photons, charged and neutral hadrons. The resulting particle flow candidates are passed to the anti-k$_{T}$ (AK)\cite{AKalgo} or Cambridge/Aachen (CA)\cite{CAalgo1,CAalgo2} jet clustering algorithms to create jets (AK and CA are two commonly used branches of sequential recombination algorithms).

The jet clustering algorithms are implemented as follows:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:jetCluster}
  &d_{iB}=p_{T,i}^{2p}\nonumber \\
  &d_{ij}=min(p_{T,i}^{2p}, p_{T,j}^{2p})\frac{\Delta R_{i,j}^{2}}{R^{2}}
\end{align}

In Eq.~(\ref{eq:jetCluster}), the pair of objects ( i , j ) denote two input candidate particles to the algorithm. $\Delta R_{ij}$ ($\Delta R_{ij} \equiv\sqrt{\Delta\eta_{ij}^{2}+\Delta\phi_{ij}^{2}}$) is the spatial distance between the two objects, and $R$ is the typical cone size of the jet. The parameter $p$ corresponds to different catagories of algorithms and will be introduced in the later paragraph.

The clustering proceeds by comparing the value of the two quantities, $d_{iB}$ and $d_{ij}$. If $d_{ij} > d_{iB}$, the algorithm will look for another possible combination of ( i , j ).  If $d_{ij} < d_{iB}$, the 4-momentum of object i will merge into j, and then the object j forms a pseudo-jet, but the algorithm will not stop looking for a new object until all particles are clustered into jet.

The parameter $p$ can be chosen as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item $p = 0$ : Cambridge/Aachen algorithm;
\item $p = -1$ : Anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm;
\end{itemize}

The difference between CA/AK algorithms is clear, CA algorithm is only considering the spatial distance of the two candidate objects (if $\Delta R_{ij} < R$, merged). In the case of anti-k$_{T}$ algorithm, $p_{T}$ of the object presents as a weight for the distance.

The anti-k$_{T}$ algorithm has better energy calibration, while the CA algorithm was found to be more efficient at finding hard subjets within the jets in simulation-based studies\cite{CAalgo3}. Therefore the CA jets are used in this analysis to identify events containing hadronically-decaying Higgs bosons.

\subsection*{Identification}
As disscussed in the previous section, this analysis use the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm with a cone radius of R = 0.8 for the identification of jets (CA8 jets). Furthermore, jets are required to pass the following loose identification criteria\cite{JetID,JetID2}:\\

Loose JetID ($>$ 99\% efficiency)
\begin{itemize}
\item Muon energy fraction smaller than 0.99
\item Photon energy fraction smaller than 0.99
\item Charged electromagnetic energy fraction smaller than 0.99
\item Neutral hadron energy fraction smaller than 0.99
\item Charged hadron energy fraction larger than 0
\item Number of constituent particles larger than 1
\end{itemize}

For the "charged" variables, $|\eta| < 2.4$ requirement are also applied, since there is no track coverage outside of this region, whereas the "neutral" variables extend to the whole $\eta$ region.

\subsection{Jet Grooming Algorithms}

The jet mass is the main observable in distinguishing a boson-jet from a QCD jet. Jet grooming aims to suppress underlying events and pile-up radiation from the target jet, and improves the discrimination by pushing the jet mass for QCD jets towards lower values while mantaining the jet mass for boson-jets around the boson-mass\cite{AN-12-137,AN-13-072}.

Typically three different grooming algorithms are considered, trimming\cite{JetTrim}, filtering\cite{JetFilter} or pruning\cite{JetPruned,JetPruned2}. Studies of these different grooming methods in CMS are presented in \cite{GroomCMS}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Trimming algorithm:} Trimming is a technique that ignores subjets (smaller jets formed by the breakup of a larger one) below a minimum $p_{T}$ fraction threshold within the original jet. Trimming reclusters the jet's constituents with a smaller radius $R_{sub}$. Then accepts only the subjets that have $p_{T,frac} > f_{cut}$, where the $p_{T,frac}$ is defined as subjet $p_{T}$ devided by the original jet $p_{T}$, and $f_{cut}$ is typically taken proportional to $H_{T}$, the scalar sum of the $p_{T}$ of all jet reconstructed in the event.
  \item \textbf{Filtering algorithm:} Filtering reclusters jet constituents with smaller radius $R_{filt}$, and sorts the subjets in order of their $p_{T}$. The final jet is thus redefined as the sum of the four-momentum of the n hardest subjets. By default the factor is n=3, but it's not a fixed number, n depands on the analysis.
  \item \textbf{Pruning algorithm:} The idea is to take a jet of interest and then to recluster it using a sequential clustering algorithm for vetoing soft and large-angle recombinations between pseudojets i and j.\\ Clustering proceeds as explained in the previous section, but it is vetoed if the candidates are too far away in $\Delta R$.\\
    \begin{align}
      \textup{veto if }\Delta R_{ij} > r_{cut}\times 2m/p_{T}
    \end{align}
    And the energy sharing is too asymmetric.
    \begin{align}
      \textup{veto if } z_{ij} = \frac{min({p_{T,i},p_{T,j})}}{p_{T,i+j}} < z_{cut}
    \end{align}
\end{itemize}

Where $z_{cut}$ and $r_{cut}$ are parameters of the algorithm (default value: $z_{cut}$ = 0.1, $r_{cut}$ = 0.5). If both these conditions are satisfied the softer one of the two candidate is not considered.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure/CH3/JetGrooming.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\label{fig:JetGrooming}Comparison of the jet mass in generic QCD events from the groomed jets divided by the jet mass of matched ungroomed jets for the three grooming techniques, for both data and the PYTHIA 6 Monte Carlo.\cite{SMP-12-019} Events are collected with a single jet trigger.}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetGrooming}, the filtering algorithm is the least aggressive grooming technique, with groomed jet masses close to the original case. The trimming algorithm is moderately aggressive which produces a much wider final mass distribution. Pruning is the most aggressive tecnique and a bimodal distribution begins to appear.

In cases where the pruned jet mass is small, jets usually have most of their energy configured in core components with little gluon radiation, which leads to narrow jets. Instead, when the pruned jet mass is large, the jets are split more symmetrically and more similar with the boson-jet structure. In this analysis we use the pruned jet mass because of its capability to improve the jet mass resolution and background rejection.

\subsection{b-tagging}

b-tagging\cite{btagAlgo,BTV-13-001} is an algorithm to identify jets originating from b-quarks. It is an important component in analyses searching for new physics. Particularly challenging are those involving top quark or Higgs boson production with decays in the boosted regime.

The methods for b-tagging are based on the unique features of b-jets: B-hadrons have sufficient lifetime that they can travel some distance before they decaying. On the other hand, their lifetimes are not so high as those of light quark hadrons, so they decay inside the detector rather than escape. Another characteristic is, the bottom quark is much more massive than anything it decays into. Thus its decay products tend to have higher transverse momentum. This causes b-jets to be wider, have higher multiplicities and invariant masses, and also to contain low-energy leptons with momentum perpendicular to the jet.

There have different approaches of b-tagging algorithm described in \cite{btagAlgo}. In this analysis, a complex approach we used will be introduced in the next section.

\subsection*{Identification using Combined Secondary Vertex}

Combined Secondary Vertex (CSV) algorithm is a complex approach involves the information of secondary vertices and track-based lifetime. In order to enchance b purity, a secondary vertex must meet the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item secondary vertices must share less than 65\% of their associated tracks with the primary vertex and the significance of the radial distance between the two vertices has to exceed 3$\sigma$;
\item secondary vertex candidates with a radial distance of more than 2.5 cm with respect to the primary vertex, with masses compatible with the mass of K$^{0}$ or exceeding 6.5 GeV/c$^{2}$ are rejected, reducing the contamination by vertices corresponding to the interactions of particles with the detector material and by decays of long-lived mesons;
\item the flight direction of each candidate has to be within a cone of $\Delta R < 0.5$ around the jet direction.
\end{itemize}

There are also requirements to the tracks that forms the primary vertex, the detail reconstruction method and selections are in \cite{btagAlgo}. After all selections, the following set of variables with high discriminating power and low correlations is used to build likelihood functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item the vertex category (real, "pseudo" or "no vertex");
\item flight distance significance in the transverse plane ("2D");
\item the vertex mass;
\item number of tracks at the vertex;
\item ratio of the energy carried by tracks at the vertex with respect to all tracks in the jet;
\item pseudorapidities of the tracks at the vertex with respect to the jet axis;
\item the 2D IP (impact parameter) significance of the first track that raises the invariant mass above the charm threshold of 1.5 GeV/c$^{2}$ (tracks are ordered by decreasing IP significance and the mass of the system is recalculated after adding each track);
\item the number of tracks in the jet;
\item the 3D IP significances for each track in the jet.
\end{itemize}

Two likelihood ratios are built from these variables. They are used to discriminate between b and c jets and between b and light-parton jets.  They are combined with prior weights of 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. The combined value is the CSV discriminator. By using these additional variables, the CSV algorithm provides discrimination also in cases when no secondary vertices are found, increasing the maximum efficiency with respect to the other algorithms (in the "no vertex" category only the last two variables in the set are available). The distributions of the vertex multiplicity and of the CSV discriminator are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CSVfromPaper}.\\
