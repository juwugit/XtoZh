\chapter{Analysis Procedures}

In this chapter, the analysis procedures of the search for $Z'$ decaying into $Z$h in $llbb$ final state are reported. The data sets and Monte Carlo (MC) samples we used in this analysis will be indicated. Physics objects reconstruction and event selections are also introduced. Moreover, background yields and the effects of systematic uncertainties will be demonstrated in the end of this chapter.
