The result of a search for new particles decaying to Z and Higgs bosons with subsequent decay to a final state containing two leptons and two quarks, $Z' \rightarrow Zh  \rightarrow llqq$, is reported. This analysis is based on the proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7/fb. Subjet b-tagging techniques are exploited for separating the signal from the SM background when the boost of the Higgs causes the two b quarks to merge into the same jet reconstructed in the detector, and the exclusion limit result based on two dimension shape method is presented.
